Description: Fast spectral algorithms for differential analysis on large-scale correlation matrices of Li et. al. (2021) <arXiv:2111.03721> are implemented. The methods can identify a group of genes exhibiting differential correlation patterns between two groups. For high-dimensional matrices, compressed spectral screening methods are also provided based on random subsampling. The work to build this package is partially supported by the NSF grant DMS-2015298.
